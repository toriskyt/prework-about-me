      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently an event manager for the School of Business at Duquesne University.</p>
      <h1>I'm from Pittsburgh, PA.</h1>
      <p>I live with my husband in a log home that is over 200 years old.  We have three dogs, two cats, and a red-cheeked conure.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to hike with my dog, Ash, and to read horror and history books.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working as a software developer.  I love everything about coding.  Even the frustrating parts, because when it finally works, there is nothing like that feeling.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>We live in a very rural area in Allegheny County.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My department lost our Tech manager in March of 2019, and I took over his duties working on the website.  I found that I loved working on the site, and especially figuring out how the code worked. To be able to have that as a full-time job would be amazing.</p>
